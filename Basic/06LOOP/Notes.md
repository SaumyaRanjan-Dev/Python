## LOOPS
***Doing some Work Repeatedly***

***Traversing through collection like list,tuples,sets***

***Running Services in systems***
## TYPES OF LOOPS
1) WHILE LOOP 
2) FOR LOOP 
### Note

There are two main types of loops in Python:

for loop: Used for iterating over a sequence (like lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, or ranges).

while loop: Repeats as long as a specified condition remains True.

Additionally, you can have:

Nested loops: Loops within loops.

Control statements: break, continue, and pass, which modify the behavior of loops.

But the fundamental types are just for and while loops.
